# User Instructions: Terminal Command Protocol

## 🚫 Restricted Actions

As per your latest instruction, I will **NO LONGER** perform the following actions automatically:

- `git push` or any git-related commands.
- `npm start`, `python run.py`, or any other execution commands.
- Any other terminal commands that render side effects.

## ✅ New Protocol

- I will strictly focus on **editing files** and **writing code**.
- I will leave **all** terminal execution, deployment, and version control steps to you.
- You have full control over when and how code is run or pushed.
