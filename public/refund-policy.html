    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Cancellation Policy</h2>
    <p>You can cancel your Curebird subscription at any time directly through your account settings or by contacting our
        support team. Upon cancellation, your Premium access will continue only until the end of your current billing
        cycle.</p>
    <p>We do not offer pro-rated refunds for partial months of service. Once cancelled, you will not be charged again.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Refund Eligibility</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>7-Day Money-Back Guarantee:</strong> If you are unsatisfied with our Premium service for any reason,
            you may request a full refund within 7 days of your initial purchase.</li>
        <li><strong>Duplicate Charges:</strong> If you were billed twice for the same period due to a technical error,
            we will issue a full refund immediately.</li>
        <li><strong>Service Unavailability:</strong> In the unlikely event that our service is down for more than 48
            consecutive hours, you may request a pro-rated refund for that month.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Formatting & Digital Downloads</h2>
    <p>For one-time purchases (e.g., specialized health reports), refunds are only available if the file is corrupted or
        cannot be downloaded. Once a functional digital file has been accessed, no refunds can be issued.</p>

    <h2>4. Processing Timeline</h2>
    <p>Refund requests are reviewed within 24 hours. Approved refunds are processed immediately and will reflect in your
        original payment method within 5-7 business days, depending on your bank's processing times.</p>
