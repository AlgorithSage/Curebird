// --- Icon Configuration ---
// Current Icon Pack: lucide-react
//
// To switch icon packs:
// 1. Change the import source (e.g. from 'lucide-react' to '@heroicons/react')
// 2. Update the aliases in the import block if the library uses different names.
// 3. The 'export const' block creates the mapping between the App's internal name and the Library's name.
