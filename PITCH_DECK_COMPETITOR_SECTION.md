# Competitor Analysis (Pitch Deck Section)

While incumbents like **Practo** and **Apollo 24/7** focus on transactional commerce (bookings/pharmacy) and government initiatives like **ABHA** offer passive document storage, **CureBird** stands alone as an **Active Intelligence Platform**.

We shift the paradigm from simple "storage" to **Predictive Wellness**. Unlike competitors that view PDFs as static files, our AI engine extracts longitudinal trends to flag health risks early. Crucially, we solve the "Doctor Burnout" crisis where others worsen it; our **AI-automated clinical notes** and high-speed **Keyboard Workflows** reduce administrative time by 20%, creating the first PHR that clinicians actually love to use.
